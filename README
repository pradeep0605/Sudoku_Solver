This project caomes with a GUI based Sudoku application.

Before running the application, make sure java and g++ (only if rebulding
things) are installed.


To run, compile and run Sudoku,

./Sudoku.sh

Sudoku.java is the GUI generating file. SSolver.cpp is the main sudoku solver. Java program
just takes in the result from the SSolver.out and uses it in the UI. An external
command called sudoku is part of this repo. That command generates
the sudoku questions. Don't delete the executables. If executables not working,
then do 'make' once and then run the Sudoku.sh script again. This should work.


Utlimately if nothing is working, you can sit and figureout the code or contact
me at pradeep.kashyap0605@gmail.com
